# BarrierRemoval

This repository contains all scripts and data relating to my masters of research (MRes) project. The project aims to rank barriers on active travel networks. The ranking will allow decision makers to understand the impact of removing barriers. The ranking will be detemined by how much more accessiable the network will be by removing a given barrier.
